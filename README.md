# Flies Fish Love
## Third Milestone Project -Data Centric Development Project - Code Institute March 2020
### What is the purpose if this App?
This app allows the visitor to look at the different components which are needed to make some of the best fishing flies.  Each fly is named and a full list of materials needed is given in a drop-down menu as well as a link to detailed instructions.  The person who submitted the description is also included as some people are fly making artists of some renown.  There is a search funtion with which the user can search for a fly by name or if they wish they can search by the person who submitted the fly. Click on the image to go to the live app.

### UX
User expectations:
A visitor to the app will expect to see a well themed app with relevant information.  This app has the potential to hold a lot of information for that reason I decided to add pagination.  I have limited my pages to 8 flies so that the visitor is not overwhelmed by too much information.  The hero image is also selected to remind the visitor of that precious moment when a fish takes your fly.  In this way I hope that they will feel encouraged to interact more with the app and to even click on the link to the sponsors page and make a purchase.

### Strategy
I want the visitor to immediatley think of fly fishing and the excitement of connecting with a fish.  I want them to learn how to tie the flies that they might need for their next fishing trip and I want them to start to think about Rodfendr Pro and to get curious enought to visit the page throught the link in the top and bottom nav bars and consider making a purchase.

### Scope
The app is designed to get the visitor to think about what flies the have, and which flies they can make themselves while adding their own creations and allowing others to see what can be done.  There is also the subtle reminder that this app is sponsored by Rodfendr Pro and they might consider visiting the sponsors page to get more information or make a purchase.

### Structure
The page is made to make the visitor want to tie a fly and go fishing with a large 'Hero' image and the relevant information pertaining to each fly and how to make it below.  The site is paginated to that the visitor is not overwhelmed.  I added a search by fly name and a search by submitted by.  Some people will want to search by those who have submitted the fly as fly tying could be considered an artform with different artists haveing a better reputation.
