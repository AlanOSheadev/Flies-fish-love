Each fly is named and a full list of materials needed is given in a drop-down menu as well as a link to detailed instructions.  The person who submitted the description is also included as some people are fly making artists of some renown.  There is a search funtion with which the user can search for a fly by name or if they wish they can search by the person who submitted the fly.
